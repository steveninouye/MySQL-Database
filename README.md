# MySQL-Database
## REQUIRED
* Using Workbench, create a database called `chirpr`.
* Using queries, create the following tables:
```
Users
  id - int not null auto_increment primary key
  name - varchar(x) not null
  email - varchar(x) not null
  password - text null
  _created - datetime default current_timestamp

Chirps
  id
  userid
  text
  location
  _created
```
* Add a foreign key to the `userid` field of `Chirps`.
* Insert 10 `Users` into your database.
* Insert 100 `Chirps` into your database.
* Practice queries:
    * Select all chirps
        * Use * to get all fields
        * Try selecting only certain fields
    * Select all users
    * Select all chirps from a certain user using a join on the foreign key
## ADVANCED
Create a `Mentions` table with the following fields:
```
Mentions
  userid
  chirpid
```
* Create a primary key that uses both columns in the table (composite key)
    * Hint: this table is a cross-reference table or many-to-many table so there is no need for an id column. (Don't worry, we'll go over these in the next lecture!)
* Create 2 foreign keys
    * Create one for `userid` that connects the `userid` in `Mentions` to the `Users` table
    * Create one for `chirpid` that connects the `chirpid` in `Mentions` to the `Chirps` table
* Insert rows into the `Mentions` table that connect chirps to users
* Practice queries:
    * Select all chirps that mention certain users
